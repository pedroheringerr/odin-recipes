		<h2>Home cooks say thin, pounded chicken breasts cook up fast and stay juicy for a weeknight meal.</h2> 

		<p>
			Get ready for a perfectly crispy and flavorful fried chicken. The secret is in the simple "dredge"
			coating, which is loaded with garlic powder, paprika, and seasoned bread crumbs for a savory, golden-brown crust.
			Pounding the chicken thin ensures it cooks quickly while staying incredibly juicy and tender on the inside.

		<h3>Ingredients quantity</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
			<li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
			<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>½ cup milk</li>
			<li>1 egg</li>
			<li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin</li>
			<li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika,
				bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg.
			</li>
			<li>
				 Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
				 Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated.
			</li>
			<li>
				 Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through
				 and juices run clear. Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.
