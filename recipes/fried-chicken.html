		<h2>Home cooks say thin, pounded chicken breasts cook up fast and stay juicy for a weeknight meal.</h2> 

		<div class="resume">
			<p>
			Get ready for a perfectly crispy and flavorful fried chicken. The secret is in the simple "dredge"
			coating, which is loaded with garlic powder, paprika, and seasoned bread crumbs for a savory, golden-brown crust.
			Pounding the chicken thin ensures it cooks quickly while staying incredibly juicy and tender on the inside.
