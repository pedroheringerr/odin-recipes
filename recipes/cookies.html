		<p>
			Making bakery-worthy chocolate chip cookies is much easier than it seems. You'll find a detailed ingredient list
			and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below:
		</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Butter</strong>: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed
				with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help
				hold the dough together.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Vanilla</strong>: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Baking Soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Water</strong>: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the
				baking soda to puff the cookies up.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients,
				but it won't make the cookies taste salty.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to
				the cookie dough.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Chocolate Chips</strong>: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips!
				You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Nuts (Optional)</strong>: Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a
				welcome crunch.
			</li>
		</ul>
